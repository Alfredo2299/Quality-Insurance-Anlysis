Here you can take a look at my last unversity project, about quality insurance of university residence for students. To analyze the quality of residence's services and student's satisfaction about them, I used R and LISREL.
You can find R-script about factor anlysis of dipendent variables (quality, satisfaction and intention) and indipendent variables.
LISREL confirmative factor anlysis about indipendent variables.
